# ProteGO Safe Android app

![Logo](./image.png "ProtegoSafe")

## Project overview

This is an Android application for [ProteGO Safe project](https://github.com/ProteGO-Safe/specs) and it implements two main features:
* User daily triage - //TODO description to be provided or linked to main documentation//
* Contact tracing - module that is fully based on [Exposure Notification API](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/) provided by Google and Apple and it's goal is to inform people of potential exposure to COVID-19

Applicaiton is structured based on Clean Architecture pattern and Presentation (UI) layer is almost fully realized with a single Fragment (HomeFragment) with a WebView control that loads a website application called 'PWA'. PWA is responsible for GUI, user interaction and 'User daily triage' feature. A website app interacts with a native code through the JavaScript bridge and is described widely [here](doc/JavaScriptBridge.md). Native application business logic is implemented in a HomeViewModel and it decides what kind of UseCase should be executed based on application state. UseCases are defined in a Domain layer and they call methods from proper repository. Repositories implementations are either in a Data module (responsible for everything that is data related - storing, fetching or manipulation) or Device module (device specific APIs not directly related to data).

App implements contact tracing module that is based on [ExposureNotification API](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/) (EN) and we can extract couple of features related to this:
* [Controlling EN](doc/ControllingExposureNotification.md): start, stop, check if device supports it, check what is its state
* [Uploading Temporary Exposure Keys](doc/UploadingTemporaryExposureKeys.md) (TEKs) of positively diagnosed user verified by the application: authorize user for TEKs upload, get TEKs from EN, add proper verification data (using SafetyNet API), upload data to the [Cloud Server](TODO_link_to_cloud_server_documentation).
* [Downloading](doc/DownloadingDiagnosisKeys.md) periodically files with batch of TEKs of positively diagnosed users (that recently uploaded their TEKs): execute periodic task responsible for downloading recently created .zip files (it fetches list of available files from CDN, selects only not yet analyzed files and downloads only these ones)
* [Providing files](doc/ProvidingDiagnosisKeys.md) to EN API for detecting exposures: get proper configuration for risk calculation (Exposure Configuration), fire EN API with list of downloaded files and configuration, delete analyzed files
* [Receiving information](doc/ReceivingExposuresInformation.md) about detected exposures: register broadcast receiver about exposures, get information about exposures, store part of information (day of exposure, risk score and duration that is in 5 minutes intervals but max 30 minutes)
* [Reporting risk level](doc/ReportingRiskLevel.md) to the PWA: extract risk scores of saved exposures and calculate risk level, pass risk level to PWA
* [Removing historical data](doc/RemovingHistoricalData.md): remove information about exposures older than 14 days


## Project structure

This is multi-module Android Studio Project. It can be compiled with gradle commands, or from Android Studio user interface.

## Project modules

- app -  all the classes related to the Android UI such as view models, adapters, views, dependency injection
- domain - in this module we place all objects that will interact with other layers
- data - contains everything related to data persistence and manipulation
- device - has everything related to Android thatâ€™s not data persistence and UI

## Build Variants

Application has 3 flavours matching environments: Prod, Stage, and Dev.

Flavours have different:

- Firebase configurations
- URL for PWA

There are two build types: release, and debug.

## Setup of the app
To get started on the app, setup and configure the following:
1. ./gradle.properties

2. Firebase - google-services.json

### Firebase and google-services.json
Setup Firebase for the different environment.
Download the google-services.json for each of environment and put into proper directory:

Prod: ./app/src/prod/google-services.json

Stage: ./app/src/stage/google-services.json

Dev: ./app/src/dev/google-services.json
